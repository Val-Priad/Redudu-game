## History 📜

Hello traveler 🧙, I created this project as my final assignment for a course that was supposed to ~~destroy us~~ teach us the basics of algorithms. At that time, I was still naïve and believed the university could actually teach me something, so I didn’t try to study extra on my own. 📚

As far as I remember, I had to submit this project with the highest possible grade no matter what, otherwise I was in big trouble 😅. In the end, this work was born out of fear 😨. I needed to impress the professor so that, despite all its flaws, he would give me a good grade. ✅

Even though it has bugs 🐛 and is terribly written (a mix of every kind of bad code 💀), I actually had a lot of fun making it “on the fly,” late at night 🌙, without any real knowledge of Flask — just a raw cocktail of fear and enthusiasm ⚡.

Since I made it for university, everything is in Ukrainian 🇺🇦. So if you don’t know the language, please use your browser’s built-in translator 🌐.
